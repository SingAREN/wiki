### For Institutions

In order to enable your users to access eduroam in your campus, you need to maintain an Identity Management System (IdMs), where your users' electronic identities are stored. You also need a RADIUS server, which will have to be connected to your IdMs. To set up an eduroam service point in your institution you have to configure your wireless LAN according to the eduroam requirements.

SingAREN will advise the participating institutions on the procedures of federating with eduroam Federation-Level RADIUS (FLR) server.
